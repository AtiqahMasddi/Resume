<br><p>My name is Nur Atiqah Binti Masddi. I am 22 years old. I am from Kuala Krai, Kelantan. I was born on April 27, 2000, in the Kuala Krai Kelantan hospital. I started primary school at Sungai Embak national school from 2007 until 2012. After that I went to Kuala Krai national secondary school at the secondary level from form 1 until form5. After that, I continued my form 6 studies for a year and a half at the same school. In 2020, I have furthered my studies at UITM Machang. I am the third child of eight siblings. My hobby is playing netball with my friends on the weekends. I often play netball at the netball court near my house. By playing netball I can keep my body healthy and fill my free time by doing beneficial things.
<br><p>My father is basically a labour and my mother is a housewife. I have a stable family and we are quite grounded in our beliefs and notions. My parents are not wealthy but we get by. My parents are attentive to my needs and my siblings. They can be strict when they have to be, but they have never raised their hands to strike us. They never pull me back and always inspire me. My mother has always been an inspiration to me. She is my absolute role model and I truly aspire to become like her. I am very happy to be born in this family. Your family is one of the backbones and supports that helps you compete in today’s fierce competition.
<br><p>one of my accomplishments is that I always represent the school in netball competitions in primary and secondary schools. At every competition, I always played hard with friends to raise the name of the school. I also have the ability to teach and recite the Quran. In my hometown, I have taught boys to recite at a recitation center.
<br><p>I also have work experience. While waiting for the results of the spm and stpm exams, I have been working in several workplaces. Among them is that I used to work in a cake shop and a bakery. I feel so happy to be able to meet new friends in addition to earning a salary. therefore, I no longer have to ask for money from my parents to buy necessities. In addition, I also used to work in a grocery store that sells necessities such as food. I was able to learn to understand the hardships and difficulties of making money. With that, I turned into a person who is not extravagant and likes to save money for future use. Life is full of ups and downs. I know this is a cliché, but this phrase summarizes my whole existence. Sometimes my life is fun, happy and almost enviable and at other times my life is boring, sad, uninspiring and sometimes downright bad. I know I am not perfect, I have never tried to be, but one thing is true.
